// This assignment will involve implementing a linear cryptanalysis attack on the weak block 
// cipher FEAL-4,as described in the course,to find the six secret sub-keys that have been used.
// This is a VERY hard assignment and will take a considerable amount of time,so please start working 
// on it as soon as possible.

// The linear cryptanalysis attack can be implemented in the programming language of your choice.
// Your program will have to loop through a lot of different possible values,so it should be reasonably
//  efficient.The source code for the FEAL-4 cipher(from which the six secret sub-keys have been removed)
//  in C and Java is provided below in the files FEAL.c and FEAL.java,so 
//  you may wish to make use of this code and implement your attack in one of these languages.An executable 
//  version of this code which has the secret key built into it was used to generate the 200 random 
//  plaintext/ciphertext pairs which can be found below in the file known.txt.

// Your task is to discover as many of the bits as possible of the six 32-bit sub-keys K0-K5 used in this
//  cipher.The more bits,the more marks you will get.However,you will get some marks for even finding a few
//   bits of the sub-keys,as this is a very difficult task.You should submit your code along with a written 
//   report describing how you went about the cryptanalysis and the results obtained through the Loop page 
//   for this module by 10 am Monday 29 th July.
